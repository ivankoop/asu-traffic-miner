# asuncion-traffic-miner

Asunci√≥n lately is having traffic problems, with this project I want to store traffic data for a few months and then analyze that data to see if the traffic improves.

maybe we can do something with this image from google search: https://www.google.com.py/search?q=asuncion+traffic+report&oq=asuncion+traffic+report+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.3784j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
